# SensorLogger
This is a side-project that I started at the beginning of 2025, hoping to expand my knowledge of MATLAB and apply it to data collection in hopes to further my data science experience. This project requires a sensor connected via Arduino to PC to log values collected over time. Includes a UI to easily start/stop collection and display realtime data. Showcases use of packages such as MATLAB UI and functions for Data collecting, plotting, and timing.
